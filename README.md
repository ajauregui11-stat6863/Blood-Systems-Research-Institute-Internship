# Blood-Systems-Research-Institute-Internship

For the HIV files, I was given a data set and tasked with verifying the table of counts that the researcher calculated on her own. 
I was then tasked with calculating chi-squares for different factors within that same data set. Finally, I was asked to develop a 
logistic regression model to predict whether a person was a true or false elite (which was a person who had lied about receiving HIV 
treatment). That model showed no significant factors for that particular response variable.


For the bottom file, TRS, I was given survey data and tasked with again verifying the counts from a PowerPoint. Then, I needed to come up 
with a way to visualize the agree/disagree statements for each of the questions within the survey. Finally, I was tasked to create a 
logistic regression model that could predict whether a person was a repeat blood donor vs not a blood donor. I represented these results 
as a forest plot of the odds ratios.
