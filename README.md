# Blood-Systems-Research-Institute-Internship

For the HIV files, I was given a data set and tasked with verifying the table of counts that the researcher calculated on her own. 
I was then tasked with calculating chi-squares for different factors within that same data set. Finally, I was asked to develop a multivariate logistic regression model to predict whether a person was a true or false elite HIV controller (which was a person who had lied about receiving HIV treatment). That model showed no significant factors for that particular response variable.


For the TRS file, I was given survey data (split into three parts: demographics, statements known to motivate blood donations, and statements known to deter blood donations) and tasked with again verifying the counts from a PowerPoint. Then, I needed to come up 
with a way to visualize the agree/disagree statements for each of the questions within the survey. The resulting bar plots are split into four separate graphs (two Motivator Bar plots containing questions 1-9 and 10-19, then two Barrier bar plots containing questions 1-9 and 10-18). Finally, I was tasked to create a multivariate logistic regression model that could predict whether a person was a repeat blood donor vs not a blood donor. I represented these results as a forest plot of the odds ratios. The motivating forest plot is from the perspective of the repeat blood donors, while the barrier forest plot is from the perspective of the non-blood donors.
